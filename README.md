# CS50P Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python) course offered by Harvard University. These solutions are intended solely for educational purposes and are meant to help learners understand key concepts in programming, problem-solving, and Python.

## Purpose

- To document my learning journey as I complete the exercises and problem sets from the CS50P course.
- To demonstrate different approaches and solutions to Python programming challenges.
- To aid others in understanding the topics covered in CS50P.

## Important Note

These solutions are **NOT** meant to promote cheating or academic dishonesty in any way. I encourage all users to complete the course independently and use these solutions as references to enhance their understanding of the material.

By using these solutions, you agree to use them only for learning and educational purposes, in accordance with the courseâ€™s academic integrity policies.
